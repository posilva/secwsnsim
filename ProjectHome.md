# The simulator now has a new branch #
In order to achieve a more stable and cleaner version, I created a new branch which is already adopting the name Wisenet.

For anyone wishing to follow the project, this branch is now the main line of development which will introduce new features.

At present the new features introduced are:
  1. Design and implementation of a model for introduction of attacks on wireless sensor networks
  1. Design and implementation of an evaluation model of protocols, based on tests that can be started on demand, timed and based on conditions
  1. Possibility of introducing a background image from Google Maps
  1. Compilation and editing Java code from attacks during the simulation (allowing to change the behavior of the simulation without restarting and compile all packages)
  1. Introduction of interfaces for custom GUI

and more

## The project ##

This project aims to design and develop a platform for the evaluation of secure routing protocols  in Wireless Sensor Networks,  within the framework of the elaboration of a master's thesis.
It is intended that the platform has the following features:

1. API for modeling secure algorithms

2. Graphical interface for reading the results of important parameters with eg power consumption, reliability, coverage of the network.

3. Modeling types of attacks, programming of malicious sensors behavior  and measuring the  impacts on the parameters mentioned above.

4. Implementing a graphical environment for viewing the network, information associated with each node.

**ATTENTION**

In the dowloads section is available a version of the simulator to present in a Workshop about WSN for master's students supervised by Professor Henrique Domingos. It will be presented in Department of Computer Science, Faculty  of Science and Technology of the New University of Lisbon.

This is a very preliminary draft which aims to present some features including definition of simulations environments, network topologies and the energy model design in WSN.
