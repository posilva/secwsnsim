abstract = {Recent advances in wireless sensor networks have led to many new
protocols specifically designed for sensor networks where energy awareness is an
essential consideration. Most of the attention, however, has been given to the
routing protocols since they might differ depending on the application and
network architecture. This paper surveys recent routing protocols for sensor
networks and presents a classification for the various approaches pursued. The
three main categories explored in this paper are data-centric, hierarchical and
location-based. Each routing protocol is described and discussed under the
appropriate category. Moreover, protocols using contemporary methodologies such
as network flow and quality of service modeling are also discussed. The paper
concludes with open research issues.},

nodes that are capable of communicating with each other without the use of a
network infrastructure or any centralized administration. MANET is an emerging
research area with practical applications. However, wireless MANET is
particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open
medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability.
Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In
general, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not
trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of
MANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the "black hole" problem-that
can easily be employed against the MANETs. We also propose a solution for the
black hole problem for ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol.},

as a central requirement. In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a
severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend
against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not
compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and
confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits)
at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another
location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can
form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc
network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For
example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism
to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer
than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a new,
general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and thus defending
against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that
implements leashes.},

extreme resource constraints with careful design; we explore the tradeoffs among
different cryptographic primitives and use the inherent sensor network
limitations to our advantage when choosing parameters to find a sweet spot for
security, packet overhead, and resource requirements. TinySec is portable to a
variety of hardware and radio platforms. Our experimental results on a 36 node

to sense phenomena, process sensed data, and take actions accordingly. Due to
the limited WSN node resources, distributed processing is required for
completing application tasks. Proposals implementing distribution services for
WSNs are evolving on different levels of generality. In this paper, these
solutions are reviewed in order to determine the current status. According to
the review, existing distribution technologies for computer networks are not
applicable for WSNs. Operating systems (OSs) and middleware architectures for
WSNs implement separate services for distribution within the existing
constraints but an approach providing a complete distributed environment for
applications is absent. In order to implement an efficient and adaptive
environment, a middleware should be tightly integrated in the underlying OS. We
recommend a framework in which a middleware distributes the application
processing to a WSN so that the application lifetime is maximized. OS implements
services for application tasks and information gathering as well as control
interfaces for the middleware.},

abstract = {In a wireless sensor network, multiple nodes would send sensor
readings to a base station for further processing. It is well-known that such a
many-to-one communication is highly vulnerable to the sinkhole attack, where an
intruder attracts surrounding nodes with unfaithful routing information, and
then performs selective forwarding or alters the data passing through it. A
sinkhole attack forms a serious threat to sensor networks, particularly
considering that such networks are often deployed in open areas and of weak
computation and battery power. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for
detecting the intruder in a sinkhole attack. The algorithm first finds a list of
suspected nodes, and then effectively identifies the intruder in the list
through a network flow graph. The algorithm is also robust to deal with
cooperative malicious nodes that attempt to hide the real intruder. We have
evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm through both numerical
analysis and simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the
algorithm. Our results also suggest that its communication and computation
overheads are reasonably low for wireless sensor networks.},

abstract = {The low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware components in unshielded
sensor-network nodes leave them vulnerable to compromise. With little effort, an
adversary may capture nodes, analyze and replicate them, and surreptitiously
insert these replicas at strategic locations within the network. Such attacks
may have severe consequences; they may allow the adversary to corrupt network
data or even disconnect significant parts of the network. Previous node
replication detection schemes depend primarily on centralized mechanisms with
single points of failure, or on neighborhood voting protocols that fail to
detect distributed replications. To address these fundamental limitations, we
propose two new algorithms based on emergent properties (Gligor (2004)), i.e.,
properties that arise only through the collective action of multiple nodes.
Randomized multicast distributes node location information to randomly-selected
witnesses, exploiting the birthday paradox to detect replicated nodes, while
line-selected multicast uses the topology of the network to detect replication.
Both algorithms provide globally-aware, distributed node-replica detection, and
line-selected multicast displays particularly strong performance
characteristics. We show that emergent algorithms represent a promising new
approach to sensor network security; moreover, our results naturally extend to
other classes of networks in which nodes can be captured, replicated and
re-inserted by an adversary.},

abstract = {An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a collection of
mobile nodes without the required intervention of any centralized access
point or existing infrastructure. We present Ad-hoc On Demand Distance
Vector Routing (AODV), a novel algorithm for the operation of such
ad-hoc networks. Each mobile host operates as a specialized router, and
routes are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand) with little or no
reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new routing algorithm is quite
suitable for a dynamic self starting network, as required by users
wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even
while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not require
global periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overall
bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than in
those protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we
can still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance vector
routing mechanisms. We show that our algorithm scales to large
populations of mobile nodes wishing to form ad-hoc networks. We also
include an evaluation methodology and simulation results to verify the
operation of our algorithm},

abstract = {In wireless ad hoc networks, nodes compromise to forward packets for
each other to communicate beyond their transmission range. Therefore, networks
are vulnerable to wormhole attacks launched through compromised nodes because
malicious nodes can easily participate in the networks. In wormhole attacks, one
malicious node tunnels packets from its location to the other malicious node.
Such wormhole attacks result in a false route with fewer. If source node chooses
this fake route, malicious nodes have the option of delivering the packets or
dropping them. It is difficult to detect wormhole attacks because malicious
nodes impersonate legitimate nodes. Previous algorithms detecting a wormhole
require special hardware or tight time synchronization. In this paper, we
develop an effective method called wormhole attack prevention (WAP) without
using specialized hardware. The WAP not only detects the fake route but also
adopts preventive measures against action wormhole nodes from reappearing during
the route discovery phase. Simulation results show that wormholes can be
detected and isolated within the route discovery phase.},

security and to prevent these attacks such as same-nonce attack,
denial-of-service attack, reply-protection attack, ACK attack, and so forth. Our
results show that, for example, with 128-bit key length and 100 MIPS, encryption

real-world problems. Limitations on available energy and bandwidth, message loss, high rates of node
failure, and communication restrictions pose challenging requirements for these systems. Beyond
these inherent limitations, both the possibility of node mobility and energy conserving protocols
that power down nodes introduce additional complexity to routing protocols that depend on up to date
routing or neighborhood tables. Such state-based protocols suffer excessive delay or message loss,
as system dynamics require expensive upkeep of these tables. Utilizing characteristics of high node
density and location awareness, we introduce {IGF,} a location-aware routing protocol that is robust
and works without knowledge of the existence of neighboring nodes (state-free). We compare our work
against established routing protocols to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution when nodes are
mobile or periodically sleep to conserve energy. We show that {IGF} far outperforms these protocols,
in some cases delivering close to 100\% of the packets transmitted while alternate solutions fail to
even find a path between a source and destination. Specifically, we show that our protocol
demonstrates a vast improvement over prior work using metrics of delivery ratio, control overhead,

We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in {WSNs} followed by a comprehensive
survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories
based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing.
Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based,
{QoS-based,} and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs
between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the
advantages and performance issues of each routing technique. The article concludes with possible

for further processing. It is well-known that such a many-to-one communication is highly vulnerable
to the sinkhole attack, where an intruder attracts surrounding nodes with unfaithful routing
information, and then performs selective forwarding or alters the data passing through it. A
sinkhole attack forms a serious threat to sensor networks, particularly considering that such
networks are often deployed in open areas and of weak computation and battery power. In this paper,
we present a novel algorithm for detecting the intruder in a sinkhole attack. The algorithm first
finds a list of suspected nodes, and then effectively identifies the intruder in the list through a
network flow graph. The algorithm is also robust to deal with cooperative malicious nodes that
attempt to hide the real intruder. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm
through both numerical analysis and simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of
the algorithm. Our results also suggest that its communication and computation overheads are
reasonably low for wireless sensor networks.},

requirement. In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks
that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the
attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and
confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in
the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there
into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially
against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For
example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against
the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting
communication. We present a general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and, thus
defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements
leashes. We also discuss topology-based wormhole detection, and show that it is impossible for these
approaches to detect some wormhole topologies.},

abstract={In wireless ad hoc networks, nodes compromise to forward packets for each other to
communicate beyond their transmission range. Therefore, networks are vulnerable to wormhole attacks
launched through compromised nodes because malicious nodes can easily participate in the networks.
In wormhole attacks, one malicious node tunnels packets from its location to the other malicious
node. Such wormhole attacks result in a false route with fewer. If source node chooses this fake
route, malicious nodes have the option of delivering the packets or dropping them. It is difficult
to detect wormhole attacks because malicious nodes impersonate legitimate nodes. Previous algorithms
detecting a wormhole require special hardware or tight time synchronization. In this paper, we
develop an effective method called wormhole attack prevention (WAP) without using specialized
hardware. The WAP not only detects the fake route but also adopts preventive measures against action
wormhole nodes from reappearing during the route discovery phase. Simulation results show that
wormholes can be detected and isolated within the route discovery phase.},

abstract={ Security is important for many sensor network applications. A particularly harmful attack
against sensor and ad hoc networks is known as the Sybil attack based on J.R. Douceur (2002), where
a node illegitimately claims multiple identities. This paper systematically analyzes the threat
posed by the Sybil attack to wireless sensor networks. We demonstrate that the attack can be
exceedingly detrimental to many important functions of the sensor network such as routing, resource
allocation, misbehavior detection, etc. We establish a classification of different types of the
Sybil attack, which enables us to better understand the threats posed by each type, and better
design countermeasures against each type. We then propose several novel techniques to defend against
the Sybil attack, and analyze their effectiveness quantitatively.},
