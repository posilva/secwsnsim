# Secure and reliable routing for dependable wireless sensor networks #

The wireless and mobile networks features a dissimilar set of characteristics and constraints compared to traditional fixed networks. The different dimensions of these characteristics/constraints and dependability issues strongly influence the reliability and security of the routing system, which is often regarded as the network-layer glue to support different applications. Routing dependability is the property associated to the trustworthiness of a routing system such that reliance can justifiably be placed on the consistency of behavior and performance of the routing service delivered.

In this thesis the objective is to investigate the dependability concept by analyzing the basic characteristics of various approaches to WS networks.

Subsequently, the idea is to derive the most important attributes and impairments that contribute to routing dependability in sensor networks and ad hoc WSN environments. Departing from state-of-the-art network designs, the idea is to create a simulation enviropnment as an experimental testbench to study, compare and evaluate the deendability criteria of different secure and reliable routing protocols for WSNs. At the same time, the experimental observation of different routing protocols in the created simulation environment will allow the recognition of possible directions and means that allow mitigating the deprivation of dependability, in the development of new protocolos with more interesting dependability properties for large scale WSN deployment.
