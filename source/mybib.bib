 abstract             = {Recent advances in wireless sensor networks have led to many newprotocols specifically designed for sensor networks where energy awareness is anessential consideration. Most of the attention, however, has been given to therouting protocols since they might differ depending on the application andnetwork architecture. This paper surveys recent routing protocols for sensornetworks and presents a classification for the various approaches pursued. Thethree main categories explored in this paper are data-centric, hierarchical andlocation-based. Each routing protocol is described and discussed under theappropriate category. Moreover, protocols using contemporary methodologies suchas network flow and quality of service modeling are also discussed. The paperconcludes with open research issues.},

Many routing, power management, and data disseminationprotocols have been specifically designed for {WSNs} where energy awareness is an essential designissue. Routing protocols in {WSNs} might differ depending on the application and networkarchitecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in {WSNs.}We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in {WSNs} followed by a comprehensivesurvey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categoriesbased on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing.Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based,{QoS-based,} and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offsbetween energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight theadvantages and performance issues of each routing technique. The article concludes with possiblefuture research areas.},

In this paper we present modifications made to prowler, aWSNs simulator, making its MAC protocol model compliant with the crossbow MICAz mote running on TinyOS. Moreover, we added radio propagation models to the simulator and, most important, we implementedan energy consumption estimation model of the CC2420 radio chip. Then, the simulator is addressed tothe development of WSNs applications with a particular emphasis on energy consumption optimization(and consequently battery lifetime). We present as case study the comparison between simulatedresults of two different physical deployments, showing how real operating conditions can affect andmodify the system behavior in comparison with the results predicted by theoretical analysis.},

It relies onprobabilistic key sharing among the nodes of a random graph and uses simpleprotocols for shared-key discovery and path-key establishment, and for keyrevocation, re-keying, and incremental addition of nodes.

MANET is an emergingresearch area with practical applications. However, wireless MANET isparticularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as openmedium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability.Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. Ingeneral, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is nottrivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues ofMANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the "black hole" problem-thatcan easily be employed against the MANETs. We also propose a solution for theblack hole problem for ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol.},

In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, asevere attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defendagainst. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has notcompromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity andconfidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits)at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to anotherlocation, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack canform a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hocnetwork routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. Forexample, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanismto defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longerthan one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a new,general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and thus defendingagainst wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, thatimplements leashes.},

Limitations on available energy and bandwidth, message loss, high rates of nodefailure, and communication restrictions pose challenging requirements for these systems. Beyondthese inherent limitations, both the possibility of node mobility and energy conserving protocolsthat power down nodes introduce additional complexity to routing protocols that depend on up to daterouting or neighborhood tables. Such state-based protocols suffer excessive delay or message loss,as system dynamics require expensive upkeep of these tables. Utilizing characteristics of high nodedensity and location awareness, we introduce {IGF,} a location-aware routing protocol that is robustand works without knowledge of the existence of neighboring nodes (state-free). We compare our workagainst established routing protocols to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution when nodes aremobile or periodically sleep to conserve energy. We show that {IGF} far outperforms these protocols,in some cases delivering close to 100\% of the packets transmitted while alternate solutions fail toeven find a path between a source and destination. Specifically, we show that our protocoldemonstrates a vast improvement over prior work using metrics of delivery ratio, control overhead,and end-to-end delay.},

With small memories, weak processors, limited energy, and 30byte packets, sensor networks cannot afford this luxury. TinySec addresses theseextreme resource constraints with careful design; we explore the tradeoffs amongdifferent cryptographic primitives and use the inherent sensor networklimitations to our advantage when choosing parameters to find a sweet spot forsecurity, packet overhead, and resource requirements.

 abstract             = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are deployed to an area of interestto sense phenomena, process sensed data, and take actions accordingly. Due tothe limited WSN node resources, distributed processing is required forcompleting application tasks. Proposals implementing distribution services forWSNs are evolving on different levels of generality. In this paper, thesesolutions are reviewed in order to determine the current status. According tothe review, existing distribution technologies for computer networks are notapplicable for WSNs. Operating systems (OSs) and middleware architectures forWSNs implement separate services for distribution within the existingconstraints but an approach providing a complete distributed environment forapplications is absent. In order to implement an efficient and adaptiveenvironment, a middleware should be tightly integrated in the underlying OS. Werecommend a framework in which a middleware distributes the applicationprocessing to a WSN so that the application lifetime is maximized. OS implementsservices for application tasks and information gathering as well as controlinterfaces for the middleware.},

In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networksthat is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if theattacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity andconfidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location inthe network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them thereinto the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especiallyagainst many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. Forexample, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend againstthe wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disruptingcommunication. We present a new, general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and thusdefending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implementsleashes.},

With little effort, anadversary may capture nodes, analyze and replicate them, and surreptitiouslyinsert these replicas at strategic locations within the network. Such attacksmay have severe consequences; they may allow the adversary to corrupt networkdata or even disconnect significant parts of the network. Previous nodereplication detection schemes depend primarily on centralized mechanisms withsingle points of failure, or on neighborhood voting protocols that fail todetect distributed replications. To address these fundamental limitations, wepropose two new algorithms based on emergent properties (Gligor (2004)), i.e.,properties that arise only through the collective action of multiple nodes.Randomized multicast distributes node location information to randomly-selectedwitnesses, exploiting the birthday paradox to detect replicated nodes, whileline-selected multicast uses the topology of the network to detect replication.Both algorithms provide globally-aware, distributed node-replica detection, andline-selected multicast displays particularly strong performancecharacteristics. We show that emergent algorithms represent a promising newapproach to sensor network security; moreover, our results naturally extend toother classes of networks in which nodes can be captured, replicated andre-inserted by an adversary.},

Our new routing algorithm is quitesuitable for a dynamic self starting network, as required by userswishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes evenwhile repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not requireglobal periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overallbandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than inthose protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless wecan still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance vectorrouting mechanisms.

 abstract             = {As sensor networks are deployed in adversarial environments and usedfor critical applications such as battlefield surveillance and medicalmonitoring, security weaknesses become a big concern. The severe resourceconstraints of WSNs give rise to the need for resource bound securitysolutions.In this paper we present SIGF (Secure Implicit Geographic Forwarding),a configurable secure routing protocol family for wireless sensor networks thatprovides "good enough" security and high performance. By avoiding or limitingshared state, the protocols prevent many common attacks against routing, andcontain others to the local neighborhood.SIGF makes explicit the tradeoffbetween security provided and state which must be stored and maintained. Itcomprises three protocols, each forming a basis for the next: SIGF-0 keeps nostate, but provides probabilistic defenses; SIGF-1 uses local history andreputation to protect against certain attacks; and SIGF-2 usesneighborhood-shared state to provide stronger security guarantees.Ourperformance evaluation shows that SIGF achieves high packet delivery ratios withlow overhead and end-to-end delay. We evaluate the security of SIGF protocolsunder various security attacks and show that it effectively contains the damagefrom compromised nodes and defends against black hole, selective forwarding,Sybil, and some denial of service attacks.},

@inproceedings{Sinkhole_attack,
 abstract             = {In a wireless sensor network, multiple nodes would send sensor readings to a base stationfor further processing. It is well-known that such a many-to-one communication is highly vulnerableto the sinkhole attack, where an intruder attracts surrounding nodes with unfaithful routinginformation, and then performs selective forwarding or alters the data passing through it. Asinkhole attack forms a serious threat to sensor networks, particularly considering that suchnetworks are often deployed in open areas and of weak computation and battery power. In this paper,we present a novel algorithm for detecting the intruder in a sinkhole attack. The algorithm firstfinds a list of suspected nodes, and then effectively identifies the intruder in the list through anetwork flow graph. The algorithm is also robust to deal with cooperative malicious nodes thatattempt to hide the real intruder. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithmthrough both numerical analysis and simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy ofthe algorithm. Our results also suggest that its communication and computation overheads arereasonably low for wireless sensor networks.},

We demonstrate that the attack can beexceedingly detrimental to many important functions of the sensor network such as routing, resourceallocation, misbehavior detection, etc. We establish a classification of different types of theSybil attack, which enables us to better understand the threats posed by each type, and betterdesign countermeasures against each type. We then propose several novel techniques to defend againstthe Sybil attack, and analyze their effectiveness quantitatively.},

For example, nodes have more severe powerconstraints, although they may transmit at shorter distances and lower datarates. A variety of physical layer wireless transmission technologies are usedin traditional wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the specificphysical layer requirements of wireless sensor networks, taking intoconsideration the particular characteristics and usage scenarios of wirelesssensor networks. We find that spread spectrum technologies meet the requirementsmuch better than narrowband technologies. Furthermore, ultra-widebandtechnologies are found to be a promising emerging alternative.},

 abstract             = {As mobile ad hoc network applications are deployed, security emerges as a centralrequirement. In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networksthat is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if theattacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity andconfidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location inthe network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them thereinto the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especiallyagainst many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. Forexample, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend againstthe wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disruptingcommunication. We present a general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and, thusdefending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implementsleashes. We also discuss topology-based wormhole detection, and show that it is impossible for theseapproaches to detect some wormhole topologies.},

The IEEE 802.15.4 specification defines medium access control(MAC) layer and physical layer for wireless sensor networks. In this paper, wepropose a security overhead analysis for the MAC layer in the IEEE 802.15.4wireless sensor networks. Furthermore, we survey security mechanisms defined inthe specification including security objectives, security suites, securitymodes, encryption, authentication, and so forth. Then, security vulnerabilitiesand attacks are identified. Some security enhancements are proposed to improvesecurity and to prevent these attacks such as same-nonce attack,denial-of-service attack, reply-protection attack, ACK attack, and so forth. Ourresults show that, for example, with 128-bit key length and 100 MIPS, encryptionoverhead is 10.28 s per block, and with 100 MIPS and 1500-byte payload, theencryption overhead is as high as 5782.5 s.},

 abstract             = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such asremote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled bythe availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller,cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaceswith which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The designof a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factorssuch as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware,and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensivereview of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su,Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEECommunications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give anoverview of several new applications and then review the literature on variousaspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1)internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocolstack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review themajor development in these three categories and outline new challenges.},
